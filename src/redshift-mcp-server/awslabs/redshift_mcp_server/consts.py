## AWS Client Best Practices

### Authentication and Configuration

- Default AWS credentials chain (IAM roles, ~/.aws/credentials, etc.).
- AWS_PROFILE environment variable (if set).
- Region configuration (in order of precedence):
  - AWS_REGION environment variable (highest priority)
  - AWS_DEFAULT_REGION environment variable
  - Region specified in AWS profile configuration

### Error Handling

- Always print out AWS client errors in full to help diagnose configuration issues.
- For region-related errors, suggest checking AWS_REGION, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION, or AWS profile configuration.
- For credential errors, suggest verifying AWS credentials setup and permissions.

REDSHIFT_BEST_PRACTICES = """
## Amazon Redshift Best Practices

### Query Guidelines

- Always specify the database and schema when referencing objects to avoid ambiguity.
- Leverage distribution in WHERE and JOIN predicates and sort keys in ORDER BY for optimal query performance.
- Use LIMIT clauses for exploratory queries to avoid large result sets.
- Analyze table to update table statistics if it is not updated or too off before making a decision on the query structure.
- Prefer explicitly specifying columns in SELECT over "*" for better performance.

### Connection Guidelines

- We are use the Redshift API and Redshift Data API.
- Leverage IAM authentication when possible instead of secrets (database passwords).
